# 📌 2: Pixel Manipulation Image Encryption

## 📖 Introduction
This project demonstrates **image encryption** using pixel manipulation. By changing pixel values through mathematical operations or swapping, the image becomes unreadable and is restored only through decryption.

## 🎯 Purpose & Use Cases
It shows how multimedia content can be protected using simple encryption techniques. This is useful for students learning about:
- Image processing
- Data hiding techniques
- Cybersecurity applications in digital media

## ⚙️ Features
- 🖼️ Pixel-based image encryption
- 🔄 Decrypts and restores original images
- 🎨 Console & GUI versions available
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight encryption approach

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pillow (PIL) for image processing
- Tkinter for GUI

## 🌟 Benefits
- Easy to understand how images can be secured
- Useful for learning **steganography** and multimedia encryption basics
- Shows how simple math operations can create strong protection

## ⚠️ Ethical Note
This project is **for academic learning**. Pixel manipulation is a basic encryption technique and not suitable for securing highly sensitive data.
